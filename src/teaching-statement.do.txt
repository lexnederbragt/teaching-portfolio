===== Om denne undervisningsfilosofien =====

Denne teksten er skrevet til å leses som et selvstendig dokument,
uavhengig av det øvrige innholdet i denne pedagogiske mappen.
Dermed er det nok noe overlapp mellom denne teksten
og de øvrige kapitlene.
I tillegg er teksten skrevet på engelsk
siden jeg ønsker å dele den med internasjonale kolleger.

===== Introduction =====

My approach to developing my teaching is based on the observation that
education is its own science, and a conviction that we should take the
results of that science seriously when we develop courses. Just as prior
research informs us when we develop our own research, so should
educational research inform us when we develop our own teaching.

Educational research is a vast field and there is a lot to learn. But,
one can not use all there is to learn, one has to limit oneself and
focus on a few areas at the time. For me, these areas are i) Cognitive
Load Theory, ii) Formative Assessment and Peer instruction, and iii)
Constructive Alignment. In the following, I will introduce what I have
learned from these areas and describe how I have implemented this in my
teaching. I will focus on a new course that I have developed in the
period since 2017, BIOS1100 -- Introduction to computational models for
Biosciences.
When developing, and improving the course, I increasingly tried to
incorporate what I have learned, and am learning, from educational
science. This will be described in the following three sections.

===== Cognitive load theory and the need to manage cognitive load =====
label{kognitiv_last}

=== Theoretical background ===

Knowing some of the research of how humans, and especially university
students, learn can (and should) inform us on how to organise, plan and
execute our teaching. The study of mental processes, including learning,
is called Cognitive Psychology. Part of this field is concerned with
cognitive load theory.

Learning theory starts from acknowledging that humans have two memory
systems: *working memory* and *long-term memory*. Working memory is
where new information is processed, and coupled to pre-existing
information present in long-term memory. It is said that learning
happens if this new information is transferred to long-term memory.
While long-term memory can contain vast amounts of information, working
memory is considered small, and has a capacity of about "seven plus or
minus two" pieces of information cite{miller1956magical}.
Cognitive load theory is "a set of learning principles that deals with the optimal
usage of the working memory" cite{caspersen2007Instructional}. This theory, as
defined in a recent review on the subject cite{sweller2019Cognitive}, "aims to explain how
the information processing load induced by learning tasks can affect
students' ability to process new information and to construct knowledge
in long-term memory". The theory argues that the limited capacity of
working memory severely restricts how much new information can be
processed at any one time. When too much is asked from this working
memory, there is a risk of overloading it, hampering learning.
Overloading working memory inhibits the effective transfer of new
knowledge to long-term memory, which is required for learning. It is
argued that instructional methods need to take these limits into
account.

=== What does this mean for BIOS1100? ===

Learning how to program is an important part of the teaching in
BIOS1100. Learning to program is generally considered difficult
cite{jenkins2002difficulty} cite{robins2003Learning}
cite{guzdial2015LearnerCentered}.
Reducing cognitive
load for students then becomes an important goal. I have always felt
students can not learn programming from looking at a slide presentation
of programming concepts, and then asking them to start programming
themselves.
I have experienced this approach myself at some time and it
did not work for me, nor did it seem a useful approach. One reason for
this is that this approach would result in a large cognitive load:
students would be required to retrieve the factual knowledge presented
during lecture and apply it to solve complex problems without any
guidance on how to approach the problem. There is thus a need for
alternative ways of teaching the fundamental building blocks of a
programming language. One that is more based on Guided Instruction cite{fisher2013Better}.

My main technique for reducing cognitive load when learning programming
is called Participatory Live Coding.

_Managing cognitive load in teaching programming: Participatory live coding_
label{samkoding}

Participatory live coding is a guided instructional technique "in which
a teacher or instructor writes and narrates code out loud as they teach
and invites learners to join them by writing and executing the same
code" cite{nederbragt2020Ten}.
The instructor reads
what is being typed out loud, explaining the different elements and
principles. Teacher and students all execute the commands or program,
leading to an immediate evaluation of the results - hence the term
'participatory'. Crucially, the session contains regular, often short,
exercises, where students are asked to solve a small relevant problem on
their own or in pairs or small groups.

I am convinced that participatory live coding can help reduce this
cognitive load for students learning programming. This approach works
better than lecturing about programming, or relying on students reading
a textbook or compendium. What is taught is immediately applied and the
execution of the program being written provides immediate feedback. This
helps student couple programming code with its result. Students'
questions arising during the session can immediately be addressed.
During this form of guided instruction, students are shown not only what
to program and how each element works, but also how to program, i.e. how
to go from a problem formulation to a working solution
(i.e., the thinking process).
It also slows the teacher down relative to using slides to
show the concepts and code, giving students more time to actively engage
with the material before moving on to the next concept. Interrupting the
live coding with exercises enables immediate practice using the
material.

The main drawback of using this technique is that it takes time to
develop appropriate material and to teach it. Additionally, it does not
scale too well as a single student with a problem that keeps them from
following along and that takes some time to fix may hold up the entire
group. Finally, students may think that they learn enough by simply
following along. They should be made aware that to properly learn how to
program they should practice, for example by doing exercises.

=== Participatory live coding in BIOS1100 ===

The first edition of BIOS1100 (2017) relied on the students using the
textbook for learning the programming concepts needed each week.
Programming was not taught during lectures for reasons described above.
Exercises were handed out during group work where students could
practice applying programming to simple biological problems. Two-thirds
into the semester it became clear that a significant group of students
did not master the Python programming, and were in danger of failing the
course. I then decided, rather than introducing more new Python material,
instead to offer some extra teaching using Participatory Live Coding. I had
learned this technique from being an instructor for Software Carpentry.
Software Carpentry, now part of the global non-profit called
"The Carpentries": "https://carpentries.org", "teaches
researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time
and with less pain" and is mostly aimed at researchers at the PhD and
postdoc level. Participatory live coding is the main method of teaching
in the two-day workshops, and learning it is part of the training
for becoming a certified instructor cite{erinalisonbecker2019Carpentries}.
In 2017, in the last weeks of the course,
I thus offered sessions re-teaching the Python material
with Participatory Live Coding, with the effect that many students
reported that they now finally understood it.

I had previously considered using Live Coding for BIOS1100, but felt it
would not scale to such a large group. The experience in 2017, and the
student's feedback, convinced me that I had to find a way to adapt the
technique of Participatory Live Coding to a course with 200 students,
starting from the 2018 edition of BIOS1100. I decided that it should be
taught in small groups, not with the entire group of students, and that
I could not teach it all by myself. My solution was to develop a
completely new set of teaching materials to teach Python programming in
BIOS1100 using Participatory Live Coding, and train Teaching Assistants
to be able to teach using this technique.
As a certified Instructor Trainer for The
Carpentries, I already had taught Participatory Live Coding to
incoming instructors.
I thus reused the material developed by The Carpentries
cite{erinalisonbecker2019Carpentries}
to train enough Teaching Assistants so that they could teach Python
using PLC during the group sessions.

The results were that string from 2018, students had a much greater confidence in
Python programming. To start learning programming using Live Coding
helped them overcome the initial barrier (sometimes fear) of
programming, and led to a feeling of mastery early on. Students really
loved the Live Coding ('samkoding' in Norwegian), reporting they
learned a lot from it. A drawback of this approach was that in 2018, much,
sometimes all of the 4 hour group sessions were used doing Live Coding
with the students. Too little time was left for students working on
their own with exercises. A master student who studied the BIOS1100
students for his project that year concluded that students lacked good
problem-solving skills because of this cite{haland2019Programmering}.

In other words, while in 2017, we did not help students enough with
learning programming, in 2018 we helped them too much and did not
challenge them enough to apply what they learned.

From 2019 onwards, the Participatory Live Coding was moved to voluntary
sessions, two hours each week. Students new to Python were strongly
encouraged to participate. In group sessions, organised activities led
by Teaching Assistants were limited to the first two hours, which left
two hours for students working on their own solving problems. During the
first two hours, some Live Coding was done to further explain concepts,
or for so-called worked examples. Worked examples "provide a full
problem solution that learners must carefully study" cite{sweller2019Cognitive},
and are another technique for reducing cognitive load.

Participatory Live Coding was what made introducing Python programming
to new Bioscience students possible. I believe this technique can be
used in many settings where students who traditionally do not have to
learn programming are introduced to it.

===== Formative Assessment =====

=== Theoretical background ===

It would be a mistake to assume that students have learned the thing you
just presented to them. Formative assessment is concerned with informing
both the teacher and the student about how much students understand about a
topic, and discover any misunderstandings. This allows for addressing
misunderstandings promptly, which helps learners to progress through the
material. Formative assessment is not graded, although sometimes
teachers make participation count towards being able to pass a course.
Note that graded assignments are what is called part of a course's
summative assessment. Ideally, formative assessment can be done quickly
and in an easy way for students and teachers to participate and see the
results.

There are many forms for formative assessment, but a very common one is
Multiple Choice Questions. A well-designed Multiple Choice Question poses a
problem with one or more correct, and multiple incorrect answers,
so-called distractors. Ideally, distractors should not be too obviously
wrong, but rather be indicative of possible misconceptions.

_Formative assessment combined with Peer Instruction_

label{formative_assessment}
Originally created by Eric Mazur at Harvard cite{mazur1997Peer},
Peer Instruction is
an evidence-based method where students are actively discussing the
material amongst themselves based on prompts provided by the teacher. By
asking students to reflect on course material together in their own
words, a student that just understood the material is able to explain it
in a way that matches better a student that almost understands the
material, than the way a teacher would explain it. Thus, *Peers* are
*Instructing* themselves.

Often, Peer Instruction is combined with formative assessment through
Multiple Choice Questions. There are different approaches on how to do
this, but commonly, a Multiple Choice Question is posed and students
consider the different answers for themselves. They then vote for the
answer they think is the correct one. The tally of votes is shown,
without revealing the correct answer. If there is a spread of answers
among the correct one and one or more of the distractors, students are
asked to discuss the question in pairs or small groups. They then vote
again (individually, not as a group). Often, the results of the second voting
show many more students converging on the correct answer. If needed or
desired, the teacher can go over the different answers and explain how
they are right or wrong.

Peer instruction has also been studied in the context of programming,
with positive results on student learning cite{crouch2001Peer}.

=== What does this mean for BIOS1100? ===

Also in BIOS1100 there is a need to investigate student learning and
check for misunderstandings. This can be partly achieved by Teaching
Assistants helping students during group work, and by studying the
obligatory assignments students hand in during the course. But, also the
technique of Peer Instruction through Multiple Choice Questions is an
ideal addition to this.

Teaching Assistants are a vital resource for student learning. In
BIOS1100, they have the most direct contact with students (during the 4
hours group sessions and the non-compulsory live coding sessions). This
means that they have a lot of experience that could inform me as a
teacher about student progress and misunderstandings. The challenge is
then how to ensure this information reaches me as a teacher, in other
words, how to implement formative assessment through Teaching
Assistants.

=== Practical implementation ===

I use the following Formative Assessment techniques in BIOS1100:

_Multiple Choice Questions and peer Instruction_

I have developed a set of around hundred Multiple Choice Questions for
BIOS1100. Some of these are based on common misconceptions I found in
the scientific literature. Often, when I observe students displaying a
misconception, or are told about one by the Teaching Assistants, I use
that as inspiration for writing new ones.

I have used Multiple Choice Questions, through the online Student
Response System "Mentimeter": "https://mentimeter.com", during
lectures and group work. I always combine this with Peer Instruction,
using the approach described above. I regularly observe a mix between
questions that are 'too simple' (a large majority of students get it
right at the first try) and questions that reveal a misunderstanding in
a significant proportion of students, that then gets largely resolved in
the group discussion. Students and Teaching Assistants really like the
"Menti's", as they are fondly called. It is an easy form of Active
Learning that helps create a dynamic group session or lecture. A
drawback is that executing Multiple Choice Questions takes time. I
usually use no more than 4 questions concurrently,
and those easily take up half an
hour or more. Ideally, I would be able to always see the tally of votes
for all questions to be able to filter out the ones that are too easy
for next time, but is it challenging to collect that data from all
Teaching Assistants.

It is fairly straightforward to adopt Multiple Choice Questions to an
online teaching setting, provided the platform used allows students to
work in small groups (for example, in so-called Breakout Rooms that
tools like Zoom offer). In my experience, this works best if the
students in these groups know each other from before, otherwise it is
much more challenging to get them to discuss the question.

_Obligatory assignments_
label{obliger}

In BIOS1100, students hand in 5 obligatory assignments spread evenly
throughout the course. These are meant to ensure students work with the
material throughout the course. The assignments are deliberately modeled
after exam problems, so as to help students prepare for the exam. These
"Oblig's" are graded pass/fail by the Teaching Assistants, and students
have to pass 80% of them to be able to take the exam. When students fail
on their first attempt for an assignment, they get two additional
chances.

In the first edition of BIOS1100, not only were there 11 assignments, I
intended these to be only used for summative assessment. I had attended
a presentation where it was argued that one should not try to combine
formative with summative assessment as assignments can not effectively
serve these two purposes. So I instructed the Teaching Assistants to
grade them without leaving any comments. It quickly became clear that it
made much more sense to give students feedback on their assignment,
regardless of whether they had passed or not.
For students, having the option to hand
in some of the work they are doing, and receiving constructive comments
on it, is very useful for their learning. Using the obligatory
assignments for this is really a very good way for *all* students to
receive such feedback, and one of the few ways to offer this to all
students throughout the course. I thus concluded that I deliberately
wanted to use the obligatory assignments for both formative and summative
assessment. From then on, I asked Teaching Assistants to give feedback
to all delivered assignments.

Ideally, I as a teacher would also study the deliveries to distill
common misunderstandings, in other words, use them as a proper formative
assessment tool for myself. Unfortunately, there has as of yet not been
enough time during the course to do this.

===== Constructive Alignment =====

=== Theoretical background ===

Constructive Alignment is concerned with aligning the learning
activities with the intended learning outcomes.
Following Biggs cite{biggs2012What}, we start with determining:

1)  The desired learning outcomes, these are the objectives
2)  How to measure whether desired learning has been achieved, i.e., assessment
3)  Appropriate teaching and learning activities that engage
    students in a way that leads to learning

Biggs calls this Constructive Alignment, which is an aligned system of
instruction where "the objectives define what we should be teaching; how
we should be teaching it; and how we could know how well students have
learned it" cite{biggs2011Teaching}.

=== What does this mean for BIOS1100? ===

Following Biggs\' approach, we should start by determining our
objectives. The learning outcomes of BIOS1100 are described on "the course homepage":
"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ibv/BIOS1100/"
("English": "https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ibv/BIOS1100/index-eng.html").
But since these are deliberately kept short, there is a need to expand
on them.
The next step would be to determine the summative assessments, in other
words, make exam questions and any obligatory assignments before the
course starts. In practice, this is not often done.
Finally, we need to design appropriate activities that help new students
learn the mix of biology, mathematical modelling and programming that
BIOS1100 aims to teach.

=== Practical implementation ===

_Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub_

To align how we teach programming In BIOS1100, we use Jupyter Notebooks
for all course activities.
"Jupyter Notebooks": "https://jupyter.org" are a form of
'computational' notebooks, combining text, media, programming code and
the ability to execute that code and include the results of running it
in the same notebook. Teaching materials, including exercises, are
delivered as Jupyter Notebooks. During Live Coding sessions and group
work, students as well as teachers and Teaching Assistants, do all their
programming in them. Obligatory assignments are also handed out, and
handed in and graded, as notebooks.
When students, assistants and teacher all are seeing and commenting code
in the same environment, discussing problems and helping each other,
this reduces the extra cognitive load of switching programming
environments.
We use a cloud-based server provided by the university, called JupyterHub,
to provide students with this programming environment.
An additional benefit of this programming
environment is that it saves the students from installing software on
their own laptop: as long as they have a working internet connection
they can log in (using university credentials) to the server and start
working.

_Exam_
label{eksamen}

Although we used Jupyter Notebooks from the start of BIOS1100,
in the first two years of the course, there was one component
that did not use these notebooks. During the exam the students had to
use a different environment which did not allow them to test and run
their code and programs. The four hour exam was done in a UiO\'s digital
exam environment Inspera, which did not have a technical solution for
running programming code. This restriction was initially a deliberate choice. In
dialogues with my colleagues who teach beginner programming courses at
the Department of Informatics, I became convinced that not being able to
run code during the exam is of benefit for the students. Informatics
students until recently even handed in their programs during the exam on
paper. The idea from not being able to execute code during the exam is
that it prevents students from getting stuck with a relatively minor error
(in the syntax, for example), and having to spend a lot of time fixing
it - which can be hard. I thus decided to follow the same strategy, the
motivation for which I also explicitly explained to the students.

However, in dialogues with students it became increasingly clear to me that not
being able to test and run programs they write during the exam caused a
lot of stress for the students. They had not experienced this way of
working during the entire semester. I also learned more and more about
the benefits of Constructive Alignment, and concluded that the exam format
led to a major mis-alignment in the course. I decided that the
situation needed to change.

Thus, in the fall of 2019, with help from the university\'s IT
department and the faculty\'s Inspera team, it became possible, for the
first time for any digital exam at the university of Oslo, for students to
submit exam assignments in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. This means
that the students could now also run and test their code before handing
it in. The result was a much increased Constructive Alignment between
teaching and examination methods.
Students were better able to show the level of comprehension of the
programming part of the course.

In 2020, due to the Corona pandemic, the exam was changed to a 4-hour
digital home exam, but otherwise organised as before. Incidentally, this
aligned the exam situation even more than the 2019 exam, as it allowed
students to use all available resources, as they are used to when
working with (obligatory) assignments.

===== Conclusion =====

After several years of continued development, I am very satisfied with
BIOS1100. I feel I have found the right format for this course, with lectures,
Participatory Live Coding sessions and group sessions. The material
written for the course, the set of problem exercises and Multiple Choice
Questions are of sufficient quality and amount.

Along the way, educational theory has informed me for the many choices
I as a teacher had to make. It has made me choose methods to lower cognitive
load, for example by successfully scaling up Participatory Live Coding.
It has shown me the importance of formative assessment, how there are
different ways to be informed about student progress and how collecting
this information can guide course adjustment immediately, or in between
course editions. Finally, it has led to a much better alignment of the
way students are exposed to programming, and work with it during the course,
with the summative assessment, by making the exam situation as similar as
possible to the rest of the activities in the course.

Students also report more satisfaction with the course now than in the
beginning. In the student evaluation of 2019, for the first time some
expressed achieving a feeling of mastery ('mestringsfølelse') in the open
questions of the evaluation questionnaire.

I plan to continue to explore educational science to make
adjustments in my teaching. I am convinced that using it as a basis for
course design is the most fruitful way forward.
