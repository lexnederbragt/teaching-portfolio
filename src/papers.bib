  abstract = {Many teachers see major difficulties in maintaining academic standards in today's larger and more diversified classes. The problem becomes more tractable if learning outcomes are seen as more a function of students' activities than of their fixed characteristics. The teacher's job is then to organise the teaching/learning context so that all students are more likely to use the higher order learning processes which ``academic'' students use spontaneously. This may be achieved when all components are aligned, so that objectives express the kinds of understanding that we want from students, the teaching context encourages students to undertake the learning activities likely to achieve those understandings, and the assessment tasks tell students what activities are required of them, and tell us how well the objectives have been met. Two examples of aligned teaching systems are described: problem-based learning and the learning portfolio.},

We identify general trends comparing novice and expert programmers, programming knowledge and strategies, program generation and comprehension, and object-oriented versus procedural programming. (We do not cover research relating specifically to other programming styles.) The main focus of the review is on novice programming and topics relating to novice teaching and learning. Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the ``fragility'' of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming?},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory was introduced in the 1980s as an instructional design theory based on several uncontroversial aspects of human cognitive architecture. Our knowledge of many of the characteristics of working memory, long-term memory and the relations between them had been well-established for many decades prior to the introduction of the theory. Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function. By the late 1990s, sufficient data had been collected using the theory to warrant an extended analysis resulting in the publication of Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10, 251\textendash 296, 1998). Extensive further theoretical and empirical work have been carried out since that time and this paper is an attempt to summarise the last 20 years of cognitive load theory and to sketch directions for future research.},

  abstract = {In this updated 2nd edition of the ASCD best-seller, Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frey dig deeper into the hows and whys of the gradual release of responsibility instructional framework. To gradually release responsibility is to equip students with what they need to be engaged and self-directed learners. On a day-to-day level, it means delivering lessons purposefully planned to incorporate four essential and interrelated instructional phases: 1. Focused Instruction: Preparing students for learning by establishing lesson purpose, modeling strategies and skills, thinking aloud, and noticing how students respond. 2. Guided Instruction: Strategically using prompts, cues, and questions to lead students to new understanding. 3. Collaborative Learning: Allowing students to consolidate their understanding through exploration, problem-solving, discussion, and thinking with their peers. 4. Independent Learning: Requiring students to use the skills and knowledge they've acquired to create authentic products and ask new questions. The authors explore each phase, using real-life examples from a variety of disciplines. You'll find tips and tools for classroom implementation, including checklists for planning and assessment; advice on feedback, homework, group work, differentiated instruction, and blended learning; answers to frequently asked questions; and examples that align to Common Core State Standards. No matter what grade level or subject you teach, Better Learning Through Structured Teaching is your essential guide to helping students expand their capacity for successful and long-lasting learning.},

Based on this brief overview we argue how an introductory object-oriented programming course is designed according to results of cognitive science and educational psychology in general and cognitive load theory and cognitive skill acquisition in particular; the principal techniques applied are: worked examples, scaffolding, faded guidance, cognitive apprenticeship, and emphasis of patterns to aid schema creation and improve learning. As part of the presentation of the course, we provide a characterization of model-driven programming---the approach we have adopted in the introductory programming course. The result is an introductory programming course emphasizing a pattern-based approach to programming and schema acquisition in order to improve learning.},

There are many factors at work. Some are simply inherent in the subject while others have more to do with the modus operandi of teaching departments. Others are deeply interlinked with the expectations, attitudes, and previous experiences of the teaching staff and their students. If computing educators are ever to truly develop a learning environment where all the students learn to program quickly and well, it is vital that an understanding of the difficulties and complexities faced by the students is developed.

  abstract = {Programmering f\aa r en stadig sterkere rolle i de ulike realfagene. Dette ser vi gjennom fagfornyelsen i norsk grunn- og videreg\aa ende skole, og p\aa{} behovet i n\ae ringslivet. Universitetet i Oslo er blant de f\o rste i Norge til \aa{} innf\o re programmering som en obligatorisk del av realfagene. Siden realfaglig programmering er s\aa, er det behov for forskning p\aa{} dette feltet. I min studie har jeg fors\o kt \aa{} kartlegge hvordan biologistudenter arbeider med programmeringsoppgaver. Informantene i denne studien har v\ae rt tre grupper med studenter som tar emnet \guillemotleft Innf\o ring i beregningsorienterte modeller i biovitenskap\guillemotright{} (BIOS1100), et obligatorisk emne for alle studenter som studerer biovitenskap ved UiO. Studien har blitt gjennomf\o rt ved \aa{} bruke en kombinasjon av fokusgruppeintervju og observasjon av gruppearbeid. I tillegg har jeg anvendt et sp\o rsm\aa l i et sp\o rreskjema som ble gitt ut til alle studentene ved BIOS1100. Funnene fra denne studien viser at studentene m\o ter en rekke utfordringer n\aa r de programmerer i biovitenskapelige emner. Utfordringene er i stor grad knyttet til \aa{} lage store programmer, forst\aa{} hva som skal programmerers, bruke ulike programstrukturer og anvende matematikk. Jeg argumenterer for at mange av disse utfordringene er en konsekvens av manglende strategisk kunnskap hos studentene. I hovedsak viser studentene til to typer strategier n\aa r de programmerer; 1) bruk av eksempelprogrammer, 2) pr\o ving og feiling. Videre ser vi at biovitenskapelige problemstillinger har liten p\aa virkning p\aa{} arbeidet med \aa{} skrive programmer, men at det b\aa de kan ha positiv og negativ effekt p\aa{} studentenes ferdigheter/l\ae ring til \aa{} l\o se programmeringsoppgaver. Samtidig virker studentene \aa{} ha st\o rre interesse for programmering n\aa r de f\aa r arbeide med biovitenskapelige problemstillinger.
