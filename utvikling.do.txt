===== BIOS1100 2017-2020 =====


=== BIOS1100 ===

2017 saw the introduction of new bachelor programs in all science
disciplines at UiO, and with it, now also the bioscience program was
going to introduce computational modeling early in the program. It was
decided to expose students to this topic already in the first semester
with the compulsory course BIOS1100 - "introduction to computational
modelling in bioscience". I was given the responsibility to design and
organise the course, which started in 2017. It is the first such course
in Norway, and perhaps in the world.

BIOS1100 aims to teach simple (mathematical) modelling, implementing
these models using the programming language Python, while all the time
focussing on problems relevant for bioscience students. The focus on
biology aims to ensure students see the relevance of the material
taught, which is important for student motivation and learning. Problems
ranging from population growth and dynamics, inheritance, DNA analysis
and disease epidemics are used to gradually introduce more complex
programming and modelling.

A textbook has been, and still is being, developed for BIOS1100. It
introduces new programming concepts, illustrating their immediate
usefulness in the context of a biological problem.

The course is a first-semester course, obligatory for all students
taking the Bioscience program. It consists of weekly lectures (2 hours),
compulsory group sessions (4 hours) and optional Participatory Live
Coding sessions for students new to programming.


FIXME: legge til Participatory Live Coding
